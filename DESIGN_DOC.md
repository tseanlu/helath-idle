# Training Idle v2.0

## What changed
- Removed **Readiness** and **Condition**.
- Replaced with clean **Basic stats**: Energy / Fitness / Form / Money.
- Advanced stats exist internally (debug in Settings), not shown in main HUD.

## UI layout
- The **main stage (runner + track)** is always visible.
- Tabs only switch the control panel: Training / Race / Shop / Settings.

## Basic stats (player-facing)
- **Energy (0–100)**: the only gating resource.
- **Fitness**: one “power number” derived from advanced stats + gear.
- **Form (emoji)**: vibe based mostly on Energy ratio; also influenced by Recovery.
- **Money**: buy gear.

## Advanced stats (system-facing)
VO2, Endurance, Strength, Recovery, Technique.
